## 🚀 Projects in Detail

### 1. Sonar Object Classification
* **File:** `Rock vs Mine.ipynb`
* **Goal:** To distinguish between underwater rocks and metal mines based on sonar return signals.
* **Methodology:** - Data preprocessing and splitting.
  - Implementation of a **Logistic Regression** model.
  - Evaluation using accuracy scores to validate predictions.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn.

### 2. Diabetes Diagnostic Predictor
* **File:** `Diabetes Prediction.ipynb`
* **Goal:** To build a predictive model that can identify whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measures.
* **Methodology:**
  - Standardization of medical data (Glucose, BMI, Age, etc.).
  - Training a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with a linear kernel.
  - Binary classification output (Diabetic/Non-Diabetic).
* **Tech Stack:** Python, SVM, StandardScaler, Scikit-Learn.

### 3. Airbnb Market Analysis
* **File:** `EDA-airbnb (2).ipynb`
* **Goal:** To explore and visualize dataset characteristics of Airbnb listings to understand market dynamics.
* **Methodology:**
  - Cleaning and filtering data.
  - Generating correlation heatmaps to see relationships between features (e.g., price vs. location).
  - Visualizing distributions of room types and prices.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas.

### 4. Boston Housing Price Regression
* **File:** `House Price Prediction.ipynb`
* **Goal:** To predict the monetary value of owner-occupied homes in Boston.
* **Methodology:**
  - Analysis of features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and property age.
  - Utilization of the **XGBoost Regressor** for high-performance gradient boosting.
  - Measuring error rates to optimize model performance.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, XGBoost, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib.
